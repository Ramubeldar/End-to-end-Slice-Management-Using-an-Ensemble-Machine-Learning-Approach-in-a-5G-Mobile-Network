# End-to-end-Slice-Management-Using-an-Ensemble-Machine-Learning-Approach-in-a-5G-Mobile-Network

Abstractâ€”Network slicing is an innovative method that
allows the creation of multiple virtual networks within a shared
physical infrastructure. Network slices are customized to meet
the specific needs of different user groups or use cases and
it providing a variety of service and performance levels. By
offering end-to-end isolation between slices, network slicing
allows for the customization of each slice to meet service
requirements such as coverage, bandwidth, latency, reliability,
and security. In this work, we proposed an ensemble machine
learning approach to improving network slicing. The ensemble
machine learning model has demonstrated promising results
in allocating resources to specific slices compared to the other
state of methods results. In this work, we address the problem
of resource allocation more effectively
